            <h2>1.Swami Vivekananda And Kali</h2>
            <article>
                <p><strong>Sadhguru:</strong>After his enlightenment, many disciples gathered around Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. One of Ramakrishna's disciples was Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was the first yogi to go to the United States in 1893 for the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, after which he caused a spiritual wave. When people were very resistant to anything new, he came and opened up the gates to some extent.</p>
                
                <section>
                    Vivekananda came to Ramakrishna and asked, "You are talking God, God all the time. Where is the proof? Show me the proof!"
